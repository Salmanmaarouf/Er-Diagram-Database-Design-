# Er-Diagram-Database-Design-


This project focuses on designing a database for a startup company called OGRE, which operates in the Generative AI platform industry. 

The Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams, created using Chen's notation, map out the key entities such as Platforms, Users, Sessions, and Administrators, along with their attributes and relationships. 

The diagrams highlight how user applications are processed and managed, ensuring the database captures all essential data for the company's operations. 

This project provides a clear and visual guide for understanding and implementing a database tailored to the needs of a Generative AI business.
